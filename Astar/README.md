This folder is dedicated to the A* algorithm.
A* algorithm is a widely used pathfinding algorithm in artificial intelligence, it is designed to find the shortest path between two points in a graph or grid while minimizing the computational effort involved in searching for that path. It is a combination of Dijkstra's algorithm and Best-First Search.
