# A* algorithm

This folder is dedicated to the A* algorithm.

The A* algorithm is a widely used pathfinding algorithm in artificial intelligence, it is designed to find the shortest path between two points in a graph or grid while minimizing the computational effort involved in searching for that path. It is a combination of Dijkstra's algorithm and Best-First Search.

The Notebook Lab1_final.ipynb is the one comparing different methods and experimenting on special sets. In the notebook Astar.ipynb you can find a simple implementation of the A* algorithm with 2 different heuristic used (it was made previous to the publishing of the teacher script).
