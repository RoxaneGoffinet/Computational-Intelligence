# Lab 4 : Reinforcement Leaarning

In this repositery wou will find everything used for the elaboration of an RL algorithm in the Lab 4 (ex lab 10).

The file **Game functions.py** contains all the necessary game functions, it hasn't be changed from the repository of the professor. 
My implementation can be seen in the file **RL** and the results are shown in **lab10-2.ipynb**.

I achieve more than 95 % win in the game against a random player
